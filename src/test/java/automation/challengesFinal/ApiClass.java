		//Q: How to implement the RestAssured?
		
		//Ans: We don't maintain separate framework for API testing in our current automation project. 
		//but we are using the RestAssured API Testing within our existing framework as a second Layer. 

		//1st we have to add RestAssured , JSON Sample, GSON 
		//and many more dependencies in pom.xml as per requirements
		
		//Inside the ParentClass we initialize all the prerequisites
		//Inside separate API Utility class We create all the CURD operation functions
		//Then we call all the API(End Points/URL)one by one for execute the CURD operations
		
		//Also we have reusable functions to validate all the response
		//Example: Status Code, Status Line, Body, Contain Type, Response Time, Response Size and many more functions
		//In order to perform  API testing I have to validate every single point as there is no UI.
		
		
		//Q: How do you implement the CURD operations?
		
		//Ans: There are many ways in oder to to implement the CURD Operation :
		//1. JAVA coding
		//2. Cucumber BDD format 
		//In my current framework I am using the BDD format as its more easy, more clear 
		
		//Implementation:
		//1. First we have to import few static imports which are related with BDD format
		
		//domain- Company website "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
		public String domain = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";
		
		//URI = specific page "/posts/"
		public String URI = "/posts/";
		
		//queryString = specific user/requirement "2";
		public String queryString = "2";
		/*
		@Test
		public void getReadTheDataFromServer() {
			
			//2. Given() method is prerequisites to pass the param() to check the Content Type  which is JSON or XML
			// given().param("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=utf-8")
			 
			 //3. When() method to provide the action where I select the CURD operation method 
			 //and pass(domain+URI+queryString)as parameter
			//.when().get(domain+URI+queryString)
			
			//4. Then() method is to validate all the required validation point
			//Example: Status Code, Status Line, Body, Contain Type, Response Time, Response Size and many more 
		//	.then().assertThat()
